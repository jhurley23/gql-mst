#GQL MST

Don't love this file structure (2 npm projects plus a third in the root for the npm scripts but it's a nice quick way to get started and keep everything in one repo for awhile)

##Aim

Models should live in the shared folder and be accessible by both the frontend and the server, models should describe the mobx-state-tree object and also the graphql schema
