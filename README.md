# GQL MST

Don't love this file structure (2 npm projects plus a third in the root for the yarn scripts scripts but it's a nice quick way to get started and keep everything in one repo for awhile)

## Running

Haven't tested using npm, but `yarn install` will install the dependencies for both server and frontend, `yarn run` will run both the server and frontend in dev mode.
